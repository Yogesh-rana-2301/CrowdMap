**Preventing stampedes and ensuring public safety through AI-powered crowd monitoring**

*Think Google Maps traffic view, but for crowds of people*

> ⚠️ I was deeply saddened by the recent tragic stampedes in India, where so many innocent lives were lost in crowded gatherings.  
> This project, **CrowdMap**, is my humble attempt to build a free, open-source solution that can help prevent such disasters in the future.

## 🎯 Mission

CrowdMap is an open-source project designed to **prevent stampedes and ensure public safety** by monitoring people density in real-time. Our system provides crucial crowd intelligence for malls, hospitals, religious gatherings, stadiums, festivals, parades, and public events.

## ✨ Features

### 🚀 Current (MVP)
- 👀 **People Detection** using YOLOv8 (state-of-the-art AI model)
- 🔢 **Crowd Counting** with advanced density estimation algorithms
- 🟢🟡🔴 **Zone Classification** (Safe, Crowded, High-Risk)
- 🌍 **Interactive Dashboard** built with Streamlit
- 📊 **Heatmap Visualization** with OpenStreetMap integration
- ⚠️ **Real-time Alerts** system

### 🔮 Future Roadmap
- 🛰️ **Drone Integration** → Aerial crowd monitoring for large gatherings
- 📱 **Mobile App** → Live crowd status before visiting locations
- 🤖 **Edge AI** → Raspberry Pi/Jetson Nano deployment for low-cost solutions
- 🛡️ **Government Integration** → Smart city dashboards for authorities
- 🔗 **IoT Sensors + CCTV Fusion** → Multi-source data for enhanced accuracy
- 📡 **Predictive Analytics** → Forecast crowd surges before they happen

## 🎮 Usage Examples

### Basic Crowd Monitoring
```python
from src.detection import YOLOCrowdDetector
from src.mapping import HeatmapGenerator

# Initialize detector
detector = YOLOCrowdDetector()

# Process video feed
crowd_data = detector.detect_crowds(video_source)

# Generate heatmap
heatmap = HeatmapGenerator().create_heatmap(crowd_data)
```

### Real-time Dashboard
```bash
# Run the interactive dashboard
streamlit run app.py

# Access via browser at http://localhost:8501
